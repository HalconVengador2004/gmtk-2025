# GMTK Game Jam 2025

This is the starting template for our team's game jam project.  

## Guidelines

- Use latest Godot version (4.4.1)
- Requierement: To use the template install gdtoolkit https://github.com/Scony/godot-gdscript-toolkit
  - Windows: pip install "gdtoolkit==4.*"
- GDscript style: Refer to https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.4/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html
- To understand the project structure read the Structure section and the Code section in https://github.com/TinyTakinTeller/TakinGodotTemplate?tab=readme-ov-file
- Code organization: Each scene should manage its own logic. Use signals over tight coupling.
